# Stat-479-group-project
# To-Do: 
1. Specify the prior distribution. Give quantitative reasoning for the choice of prior beta_1, \beta_2. 
2. Create 4000 16 times 16 pairwise matrices for simulation
3. Complete 4000 posterior simulations with 4000 pairwise matrices from part 1. and compare the result 
4. Repeat part 1. and part 2. for a reduced model with only detlaOEFF and deltaDEFF
5. Compare the accuracy with real-life scenario eg). the square prob < 0.25? 
6. Finishing the final report
7. Finish the final presentation slides and distribute workload for each group member in the presentation
